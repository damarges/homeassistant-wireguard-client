WireGuard: fast, modern, secure VPN tunnel.

## About

[WireGuardÂ®][wireguard] This fork aims to make Wireguard available as a client (instead of acting as a server) on Home Assistant installations. 

As (like me myself) several people are asking to have Home Assistant connect as a client to an Wireguard Server I decided to make that possible. 

I haven an ISP that keeps me behind CG-NAT (in Germany also called DS-Lite) so no chance to connect to my home assistant solution from the internet. Only chance is so have an wireguard server running somewhere else (for example a small VPS solution at some hosting company) and connect to that server and on the server expose a port/domain (behind nginx-proxy with SSL encryption) ...
